# 🏥 Nexus Healer — AI-Powered Healthcare Triage Platform

**Nexus Healer** is an intelligent healthcare triage system that leverages **Google Gemini AI** to analyze patient symptoms in real-time and deliver instant, prioritized medical assessments. Built for speed and accuracy, it combines cutting-edge AI with a robust rule-based fallback engine — ensuring it works reliably even without an API key.

## ✨ What It Does

Patients enter their symptoms and vital signs, and Nexus Healer instantly:
- 🔍 **Identifies potential conditions** with confidence scores
- 🚨 **Assigns a triage priority** (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) based on severity
- 📊 **Calculates a risk score** (0–100) factoring in vitals and demographics
- 💊 **Provides actionable recommendations** and immediate actions
- 📈 **Logs all assessments** to a cloud dashboard for medical staff review

## 🤖 AI Integration

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Primary AI** | Google Gemini 2.0 Flash via `@google/generative-ai` SDK |
| **Fallback Engine** | Comprehensive rule-based triage with 50+ symptom patterns |
| **Symptom Analysis** | NLP-driven extraction and matching of patient descriptions |
| **Vital Signs AI** | Automated assessment of BP, temperature, heart rate, and SpO₂ |
| **Confidence Scoring** | AI returns ranked conditions with probability percentages |

The system gracefully degrades — if the Gemini API key is unavailable or the AI call fails, it automatically falls back to the built-in rule-based engine with zero downtime.
